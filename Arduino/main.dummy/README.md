# About main.dummy.ino
An Arduino program simulating the behaviour of an Arduino that actually
receives data from sensors. This program can be used to test the communication
with the Raspberry Pi web server. In practice this was used to simulate several
cages with a few Arduino's on a demonstration, while only one actual cage was provided with sensors.
